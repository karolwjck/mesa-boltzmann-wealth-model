# mesa-boltzmann-wealth-model
[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) is a Python framework for [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model). 

## How it works?
The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent-based economy, drawn from econophysics and presenting a statistical mechanics approach to wealth distribution [Dragulescu2002]. The rules of our tutorial model:

1. There are some number of agents.
2. All agents begin with 1 unit of money.
3. At every step of the model, an agent gives 1 unit of money (if they have it) to some other agent.

## How to run it?
